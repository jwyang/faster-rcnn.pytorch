# res101.yaml 

This file hopes to explain the parameters used in these config files.. what they do and why

`EXP_DIR` - Guessing this is export directory default

#TRAIN:

`HAS_RPN` - Region Proposal Network (Seems unused everywhere in the PyTorch Code) see : `https://medium.com/@fractaldle/guide-to-build-faster-rcnn-in-pytorch-95b10c273439` for more on RPN

`BBOX_NORMALIZE_TARGETS_PRECOMPUTED` - guessing this is true if bounding boxes are pre-normalized (instead of raw pixels)
